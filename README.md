# Summary
Developer Resources is a collection of all the resources for developers.
We cover all the resources in the following areas of development:
* Frontend Development
* Backend Development
* Mobile Development
* Game Development
* Algorithms and Data Structures
* Interview Prep.  
* DevOps

Each of these sections will include a table of contents in order for you to navigate to the sections that matter the most to you.

Each Section will also begin with a Credit section to all the Github repositories from which we could have gotten some of resources listed in here  

We have made an effort to include as many free resources as possible. However we also understand that there are quality resources out there that might cost you a penny but totally worth it.
We will be sure to indicate the resources that are paid.

We Invite as many contributions as possible.
